First off, thank you so much for even reading this!  
This project is full of low hanging fruit for developers and non-developers alike, here are some contributions that I would greatly appreciate.  
* fix spelling errors and grammatical errors in **any** of this projects documentation.  
* improve the readability of the rust code  
* add/remove words from the word list(s) that do not belong (uncommon words, plurals etc.)  
* figure out a better way to create a global `wordle` command, right now I have the `setup.sh` file, but there should be a better way to do it  
* write/improve comments in the code  
* Write test cases for the program, as of now I have none but tests are always good to have.
